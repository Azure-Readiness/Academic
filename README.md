            <div class="hidden">This repo provides technical resources for faculty, students, and Microsoft developer advocates for use in computer science learning forums. There are four categories: Instructor-led, Problem Sets, Tech Talks, and Workshops. The content covers common cross-platform scenarios for learners including mobile app dev (C#/Xamarin), web dev (JavaScript, Node.JS), and data science with machine learning (Hadoop, Spark). Hands-on learning includes deployment on cloud solutions like Microsoft Azure.  </div>
